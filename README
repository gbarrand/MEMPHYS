 To build 
   UNIX> cd MEMPHYS/mgr
   UNIX> <in ./use_geant4 edit geant4_home to point to your geant4 10.x installation>
   UNIX> <in run_g410x_setup[.sh,.csh] edit the g4data_home variable to point to the geant4 10.x data>
  Linux> <if needed source setup a gcc_[version].[sh,csh] file to have the correct g++>
  ( csh> source gcc_493.csh # on Lund iridium )
   UNIX> ./build
  (UNIX> ./build -v  # to see built files.)
  (UNIX> ./build -x  # for a full trace.)

 If having CERN-ROOT :
   UNIX> <in cern_root_setup[.sh,.csh] edit root_home to point to your CERN-ROOT installation>
     sh> . ./cern_root_setup.sh
   or from a csh flavoured shell :
    csh> source ./cern_root_setup.csh
   UNIX> ./build -root

 At end of build a zip file with the simulation ready for distribution should be under :
   bin_<config>/distrib/MEMPHYS-<version>-<platform>.zip

 and the visualization should be in :
   bin_<config>/distrib_vis/MEMPHYS-<version>-<platform>.zip

  For some platform, the visualization may be in a specific bin_<config> which is not the one
 of the simulation. Fr example on Mac, the simulation, that needs no graphics, is in bin_clang_c++11
 and the visualization, being done with Cocoa, is in bin_sdk_mac_c++11.
