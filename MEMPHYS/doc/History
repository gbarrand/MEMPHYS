11.0.0 : have the simulation only. The visualization is now delivered in the MEMPHYS_vis package with the same version number.
- have the cmake directory to build with cmake following the Geant4 example way.

10.2.0 :
- vis : plot : hits edep.
- vis : PMS represented with inlib::sg::bifacet (more effective than sg::tube).
- vis : "axes" menu item.
- vis : "cam top toward -z" menu item.
- vis : params => gui_font_modeling : can set now "font_pixmap" which gives a better rendering of texts.
- vis : Windows, iOS, Android with ourex/geant4.10.03.p01.
- vis : Android : inputEventFile => input.memphys, jobOptions.mac => job_options.mac.
- mgr/use_geant4 : for g410x, use ourex/geant4.10.03.p01.
- * : modifs to remove "pedantic warnings" if compiling with the "geant4-config --cflags" options.

10.1.0 :
- build with clang++ on iridium.
- First version of the visualisation done on inlib/sg in the distrib.
- DetectorConstruction : tilt "Rock" so that it is not inside the WC tank ! See "_y -= " code with //GB comment.

10.0.0 : 12 July 2017 :
- over geant4 10.03.p01.
- Have it on Windows-10/VC-14.

30 Mai 2017 : G.Barrand
- 9.0.0 : strong revision of the code. Have it for Linux and Mac.

08 July 2006 : G.Barrand
- Analysis.cxx : book tuples only if in batch.
  Else, if working with MEMPHYS_session, we book in memory the tuples 
  and especially the geometry one that consumes memory.
- DetectorConstruction.cxx, EventAction.cxx : be able to run without 
  having booked tuples ; for example if running with MEMPHYS_session. 

23 June 2006 : G.Barrand
- Analyis, MEMPHYS_batch, MEMPHYS_session, MEMPHYS_analyis : 
  handle first command arg to be able to AIDA chanage file format
  (to test HDF5 over MEMPHYS).
- Analysis, DetectorConstruction, EventActiona, 
  MEMPHYS_batch, MEMPHYS_session : 
  arrange to be able to run MEMPHYS_batch over a dummy AIDA implementation.
  For example with OpenScientist/Falsetto. This may be usefull to 
  see the overhead of the AIDA IO.
