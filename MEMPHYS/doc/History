- Analysis.cxx : book tuples only if in batch.
  Else, if working with MEMPHYS_session, we book in memory the tuples 
  and especially the geometry one that consumes memory.
- DetectorConstruction.cxx, EventAction.cxx : be able to run without 
  having booked tuples ; for example if running with MEMPHYS_session.

- Analyis, MEMPHYS_batch, MEMPHYS_session, MEMPHYS_analyis : 
  handle first command arg to be able to AIDA chanage file format
  (to test HDF5 over MEMPHYS).
- Analysis, DetectorConstruction, EventActiona, 
  MEMPHYS_batch, MEMPHYS_session : 
  arrange to be able to run MEMPHYS_batch over a dummy AIDA implementation.
  For example with OpenScientist/Falsetto. This may be usefull to 
  see the overhead of the AIDA IO.
