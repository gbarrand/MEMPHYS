A description of the cluster is given here:

please read at least the following before beginning:

To login into it, open a terminal, and run:

 ssh -X <user>@nptest-iridium.lunarc.lu.se

In most cases you will need information from your research group. What
comes below is generic information for the cluster use.

To initialize the ATLAS environment, run:
  module load enableATLAS;
  setupATLAS

To setup a ROOT environment, run

localSetupROOT

From now on you can use ROOT.

It is recommended to use the SLURM batch system to use
the nodes (this is the way one calls other computers in a cluster)

However, you may access nodes directly by doing, for example:
  ssh -X n10
