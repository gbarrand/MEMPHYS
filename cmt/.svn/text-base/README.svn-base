  To build :
 - have a look and edit if needed the meta_setup.csh.
   In it you have to say where is the OpenScientist binary installation.
 - source the meta_setup. 
 - build with "cmt config" and "gmake". 

  To run source the meta_setup and the setup and launch an application.

  Note that the "meta setup" informations are something that can be put 
 in login scripts.
